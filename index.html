			<h1>Summary</h1>
			<p><i>There are men with guns in this building. They want to kill you. You too have a gun. What do you do?</i> </p>
			<p>Hideous Destructor is designed around this principle: to bring back that feeling of doom in Doom. The men with guns can and will shoot to kill; if you survive, their demonic controllers can easily finish you off in more horrific ways. </p>
			<p>Your motions are limited to human levels and any attack can leave you bleeding, burning or choking to death if it doesn't kill you outright. Episode 1 will be populated by a force that actually appears capable of eliminating a platoon of trained marines not unlike the player. Your opposition is swift, brutal and relentless, and you must be even more so to survive. </p>
			<p>You may start the game with nearly any weapon you wish, or brave the impossible as the naked doomed marine with a pistol and 50 rounds. An array of advanced gadgetry and magical artifacts is available to give you a second chance when you need it most - which will be often. </p>
			<p><i>The men with guns know you're here. There's no turning back now.</i></p>

			<h1>Features</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Deadlier, faster weapons and monsters for more intense fights. </li>
				<li>Special monster attacks that take advantage of each monster's tactical and aesthetic niche. </li>
				<li>Detailed weapon behaviour including visible recoil, muzzle climb and weapon inertia and collision. </li>
				<li>Customized survival-based game modes for multiplayer. </li>
				<li>Designed to be compatible with the original Doom visual style. </li>
			</ul>
